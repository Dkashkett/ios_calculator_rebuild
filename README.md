# ioS Calculator 

This is a rebuild of the iOS calculator that I built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript as part of a web development course through Frontend Masters. The backend uses node and express so you will need to download those dependencies to run it. 

You should be able to run the command: node index.js in the commmand line and got to localhost:8000 in your browser to use the calculator.
